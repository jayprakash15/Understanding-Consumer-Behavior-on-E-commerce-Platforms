# Understanding-Consumer-Behavior-on-E-commerce-Platforms
This was my final year project, while I was doing bacholers in statistics. As a part of our project it was mandatory for us to conduct survey and collect the data.
I can't share actual data, but will definately share summary of project, code used for analysis and drawing inference from data.

Short project description:
Analyzed survey data using inferential statistics to study gender and demographic variations in product category preferences. Applied hypothesis testing to validate that discounts and cashback significantly increased purchase likelihood across all age groups, confirming price sensitivity in consumer behavior.

Result of project:
• Analyzed survey data using inferential statistics to study gender and demographic variations in product
category preferences.
• Applied hypothesis testing to validate that discounts and cashback significantly increased the likelihood of
buying, across all age groups, confirming price sensitivity in consumer behavior.

Tech Stack used in project:
